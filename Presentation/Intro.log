               {Motivation}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
